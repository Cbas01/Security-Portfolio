Security Analyst Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on work while transitioning into a Security Analyst role, with a primary focus on vulnerability analysis and structured lab investigations.

The goal is to strengthen technical understanding of real-world vulnerabilities (CVE reports) and develop analytical skills relevant to entry-level security analysis roles.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze publicly disclosed CVEs to understand root cause and impact

Study exploitation mechanics from a defensive perspective

Identify detection opportunities and mitigation strategies

Practice structured technical reporting

Document lab investigations clearly and methodically

📁 Repository Structure
/CVE-Writeups

Technical analysis of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.

Each CVE report includes:

Overview and affected versions

Technical explanation of the vulnerability

Exploitation overview (conceptual, not weaponized)

Impact assessment
