# Security-Portfolio

This repository documents my practical work while transitioning into a Security Analyst role.
It contains structured CVE analysis reports and defensive lab writeups focused on understanding vulnerabilities, analyzing attack behavior, and identifying detection and mitigation strategies.
The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate analytical thinking, technical fundamentals, and investigative capability aligned with entry-level Security Analyst responsibilities.

Objectives
-Strengthen vulnerability analysis and threat investigation skills
-Practice structured technical reporting
-Develop detection-focused thinking (not just exploitation awareness)
-Improve log interpretation and security event analysis
-Build consistent documentation habits aligned with security operations work
